# Pokémon Randomizer Fiesta

Pokémon Randomizer Fiesta is a tool designed to generate random Pokémon teams for the main series games. Inspired by the [Final Fantasy V Four Job Fiesta](https://www.fourjobfiesta.com/), no game data is edited and the user is encouraged to play with the self-imposed rules on an unmodified game if they wish. This approach allows for a vanilla experience while also presenting a new way to experience the game. By default, generated teams will include Pokémon seperated by badge milestone in a similar fashion to Four Job Fiesta. Various modifiers are included which may be found below.
